# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should not be reported publicly until we have had a chance to address them.

### 2. Email us directly

Send an email to: `security@pr-review-agent.com` (or create a private security issue)

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Development**: 1-2 weeks (depending on severity)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released

## Security Considerations

### API Keys and Secrets

The PR Review Agent handles sensitive information:

- Git server API tokens
- AI service API keys
- Repository access tokens

**Security measures implemented:**

1. **Environment Variables**: All secrets are stored in environment variables
2. **Configuration Validation**: Secrets are validated but never logged
3. **Memory Clearing**: Sensitive data is cleared from memory when possible
4. **No Persistence**: API keys are not stored in configuration files

### Network Security

- **TLS/SSL**: All API communications use HTTPS
- **Token Validation**: API tokens are validated before use
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect API rate limits to prevent abuse
- **Timeout Handling**: Network requests have appropriate timeouts

### Code Analysis Security

When analyzing code, we:

- **Sandboxed Analysis**: Code analysis runs in isolated environments
- **No Execution**: We analyze code statically, never execute it
- **Temporary Files**: Any temporary files are securely cleaned up
- **Access Controls**: Only analyze files with proper permissions

### AI Service Security

When using AI services:

- **Data Minimization**: Only send necessary code snippets
- **No Sensitive Data**: Filter out secrets and personal information
- **Provider Selection**: Use reputable AI service providers
- **Audit Logs**: Maintain logs of AI service interactions (without sensitive data)

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Environment Setup

1. **Use Virtual Environments**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Secure API Key Storage**
   ```bash
   # Use .env file (never commit to git)
   echo "GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here" >> .env
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here" >> .env
   ```

3. **File Permissions**
   ```bash
   # Secure your .env file
   chmod 600 .env
   ```

### Configuration Security

1. **Minimal Permissions**: Use API tokens with minimal required permissions
2. **Token Rotation**: Regularly rotate API tokens
3. **Environment Separation**: Use different tokens for different environments

### Repository Access

1. **Read-Only Access**: Use read-only tokens when possible
2. **Scope Limitation**: Limit token scope to specific repositories
3. **Audit Access**: Regularly audit which repositories have access

## Known Security Considerations

### Dependencies

We regularly audit our dependencies for security vulnerabilities:

- **Automated Scanning**: Use tools like `safety` and `bandit`
- **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies up to date
- **Vulnerability Monitoring**: Monitor security advisories

### Data Handling

1. **Code Privacy**: Code content is processed locally and sent only to configured AI services
2. **Temporary Storage**: Any temporary files are created with secure permissions
3. **Log Sanitization**: Logs are sanitized to remove sensitive information

### AI Service Data

When using AI services:

1. **Data Retention**: Understand the data retention policies of AI providers
2. **Processing Location**: Be aware of where your data is processed
3. **Compliance**: Ensure AI service usage complies with your organization's policies

## Security Monitoring

### Logging

The application logs security-relevant events:

- Authentication attempts
- API key validation failures
- Unusual access patterns
- Error conditions that might indicate attacks

### Monitoring

Monitor for:

- Unusual API usage patterns
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unexpected network traffic
- Resource exhaustion attacks

## Incident Response

If you suspect a security incident:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Revoke compromised API tokens
   - Check audit logs
   - Assess impact scope

2. **Investigation**:
   - Preserve evidence
   - Document timeline
   - Identify root cause

3. **Recovery**:
   - Apply security patches
   - Generate new tokens
   - Update configurations

4. **Communication**:
   - Notify affected users
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update security procedures

## Security Updates

We provide security updates through:

- **GitHub Security Advisories**
- **Release Notes**
- **Email Notifications** (for critical vulnerabilities)

### Applying Updates

1. **Monitor Releases**: Watch the repository for security releases
2. **Test Updates**: Test security updates in non-production environments
3. **Apply Promptly**: Apply security updates as soon as possible

## Compliance

The PR Review Agent is designed to help maintain compliance with:

- **SOC 2**: Secure development practices
- **GDPR**: Data privacy and protection
- **SOX**: Code review and audit trails
- **HIPAA**: Secure handling of sensitive code (healthcare organizations)

## Security Features

### Built-in Security Analysis

The tool includes security analyzers that check for:

- Hardcoded secrets
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Insecure cryptographic practices
- Unsafe file operations

### Configuration Validation

- Schema validation for all configuration files
- Environment variable validation
- API token format validation
- Network endpoint validation

### Audit Trail

The tool maintains an audit trail of:

- Review activities
- Configuration changes
- API interactions
- Error conditions
